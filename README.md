## Data Exploration

1. The Sales Dataset has 18 features and 9800 samples.

2. the dataset has fewer null values.


## Feature Engineering.

Adding new columns from existing colums can help exploring underlying data.


## Exploratory data analysis.

An EDA is a thorough examination meant to uncover
 the underlying structure of a data set and,
 is important for a company because it exposes trends,
patterns, and relationships that are not readily apparent.

This practise answer few questions as follows:
1.which month had the most sales in 2018?how much amount was earned that month?


2.which state had the most sales in 2018?

3.which product was sold the most?
## Encoding.

Encoding columns with multiple categories helps dataset to be compatible with algorithm.

Here we are using the map function instead of labelencoder or onehotencoder.

dropping columns not important for analysis or further predictions.
